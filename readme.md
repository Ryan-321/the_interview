# The Interview

For the next 2 days of morning exercises, we've provided two coding challenges!

Both of these challenges were exercises that our very own instructors had to solve for a job interview process!


It's ok to struggle through these challenges, they're tough!

## The First Challenge - Hogwarts
Persumably, you all want to put rails on your resumé. So we want to do a quick refresher on server side web applications.

Fork/Clone [this repo](https://github.com/ga-dc/hogwarts_rails).

This repo contains a web application all about Hogwarts! But it's completely broken.

### Your job
Remember how to do rails.

Fix it!

### Bonus
Add functionality so students can enroll at Hogwarts (Creating a new student). You should implement a sorting hat method to randomly assign new students to one of Hogwarts' four houses.
